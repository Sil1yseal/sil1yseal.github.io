# About Me
Hello! I am Sil1yseal.
I like playing guitar, my goal is to become a mariachi teacher. My favorite animals are seals

Being a mariachi teacher is my top career goal because I would like teaching people how to play instruments and they make a decent amount of money.
  It connects with my lifestyle goals because the salary of the career I want makes more then enough of what a I need to live the lifestyle I want.
The communication and collaboration skills will help with the career I want because teachers need to socialize with their students and collaborate with them to teach them.
